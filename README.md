# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. 
Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too.
In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. 
We compare the values of the root attribute with the recordâ€™s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.
It is a model used to create a decision tree classifier and to visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier , it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
